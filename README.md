# Genesis

A static site generator - **without the command line**.

Genesis allows you to create a static site and deploy to [Surge](https://surge.sh) all from a nice desktop application.

## Development Setup

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/siecje/genesis
$ cd genesis
$ npm install
```
- Download and extract [NW.js](http://nwjs.io/)

From the Genesis folder use the path to the ```nw``` file in the extracted folder.
```shell
$ /path/to/nw .
```

The Genesis Desktop application should open.
